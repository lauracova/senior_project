# Repository for my senior project

##Project Proposal

I plan to make a Shiny App that will allow a user to search for any name, state, or year and see visualizations and information about the name. Some visualizations I would like to have: 1. trend in name over time 2. rank of name 3. prediction of name 4. interactive map of names. I would also like to show the meaning of the name and famous people with that name.

`imageprocessing`- contains all work for the image classification and object detection project

`names` has the work for the names project

`final_deliverables`- Will contain the final product of my project
