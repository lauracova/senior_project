*This folder contains all work for the image classification and object detection project*

readimages.R- learned about reading images into r, got the RGB data from them, played with changing RGB values and changing image to grayscale, experimented with gradients, learned about datatypes/classes of images

images.md - notes on image classes and reading images

resources.md - resources on machine learning (neural networks)

5/2 YOLO.R - use the R package image.darknet and a tiny YOLO model for object detection in a given image, in just 3 lines of R code

5/2 keras.R - attempt to use the keras package in R

5/2 tensorflow- use for object detection

5/2 cnn- Convolutional Neural Networks commonly used for image processing
